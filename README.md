# Flipkart-sales-data-PowerBI-Project

### Overview:
POWER BI is a powerful data visualisation platform used primarily for business intelligence purposes and I have used it to create my project for dashboard creation for demo Flipkart sales data. This POWER BI Dashboard would give a holistic view of the sales trends on Flipkart across various geographic regions along with various payment methods used for the transactions.
