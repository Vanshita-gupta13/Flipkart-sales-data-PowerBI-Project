# Flipkart-sales-data-PowerBI-Project

### Overview:
POWER BI is a powerful data visualisation platform used primarily for business intelligence purposes and I have used it to create my project for dashboard creation for demo Flipkart sales data. This POWER BI Dashboard would give a holistic view of the sales trends on Flipkart across various geographic regions along with various payment methods used for the transactions.

### Steps to open project:

- You should have the Power BI desktop application installed in the system.
- Download the flipkart sales.pbix file which is added to the root directory. This file carries the actual dashboard created through power BI.
- Download the flipkart_sales_data.csv file which is added to the root directory. This file will be the data source for our power BI dashboard. Keep it in the same directory as the dashboard in-case you get any errors while opening the dashboard directly on power BI.
- Open power BI desktop application and open the flipkart sales.pbix file. You should be seeing the dashboard coming up. HURRAY!
- Play around the buttons and trend charts on the dashboard to get the insights.
